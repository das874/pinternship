## First Week Internship Experience

It is important to stay active on LinkedIn. We see that many of you are very active already. We want to incentivize your activity by throwing a challenge. (Exciting gifts and perks in store).

### Why this exercise

1) This will give you a lot of followers from the current cohort,  so that you get to stay in touch with them and all of us.    
2) This will help you get new connections, as many people comment on your posts. Your post will start being visible to your links' links too.
